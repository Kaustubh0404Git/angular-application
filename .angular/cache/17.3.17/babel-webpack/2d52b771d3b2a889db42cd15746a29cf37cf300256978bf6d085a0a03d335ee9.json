The curriculum blends theory with practical labs to ensure you can think like an attacker while acting as a defender. By the end of the program, you will be able to assess risks, execute controlled tests, document findings, and provide actionable remediation steps. This program aligns with EC\\u2011Council\\u2019s standards and culminates in an industry\\u2011recognized certificate that validates your applied skills.
